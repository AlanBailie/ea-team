# Creating a new service.

To create a new service on Gov.UK you must first create an organisation to host your service. This organisation will contain the different spaces (environments) required. Please refer to [DoF DSS Model](/docs/cloud/gov-uk-paas/dof-dss-model.md) for more information

To request a new organisation you should do the following
1. Decide on a name for your service. See [Org Naming Conventions]() for help
2. Submit a request to (ea-team@ea.finance-ni.gov.uk) to have the organisation created.
      You should include the following

    * The name of the Organisation
    * The spaces (environments) you want to create. If you do not specify any we will create Sandbox, staging and production
    * List your space developers and space managers ([See Users and Roles for more information()])
    * Specify the Org billing contact. This is the individual(s) that bills for running the service will be sent to.

    **Please Note:** DoF DSS Enterprise Architecture team reserve the Org Manager and Org Billing Manager role. See [Users and Roles]() for more information
