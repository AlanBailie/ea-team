# DSS Enterprise Architecture Team

## What do we do?
The team facilitates and supports the delivery of digital services that enable the transformation of the business of Government.

## How do we do it?
We do it by:
- recognising the problems our customers are facing
- understanding our customer's aims, objectives and ambition
- baselining the current state
- creating a target architecture
- creating a roadmap to the desired end state

We use various industry standard approaches and in doing so help to ensure that proposed solutions:
- align with applicable NICS strategies
- adhere to NICS architecture principles and standards
- provide the desired business outcomes

Where we are not responsible for the delivery of architecture artefacts we can help to ensure that solutions being proposed by delivery partners undergo the same level of scrutiny as those produced internally.

## What are we working on?

We are working on the implementation of the [Citizen Services Architecture Roadmap](https://docs.ea.digitalni.gov.uk/#roadmap). In Q3 2019 we are working specifically on the following Phase 1 initiatives:
- [API Management](initiatives/phase-one/api-management)
- [Documentation and configuration repository](initiatives/phase-one/documentation-config-repo)
- [Usage Tracking Service](initiatives/phase-one/usage-tracking-service)
