# Architecture Principles

Architectural Principles are long-lasting and rarely changing statements and guidelines that govern the design, implementation and operation of the solutions. They are derived from the specific needs and priorities of the stakeholders and provide a decision-making framework for the architecture that govern its construction. A list of architectural principles defined in this section are the ones to drive architectural decisions for any citizen facing e-service or service delivery supporting platform implementation in NICS. Architectural principles can cover approaches at various levels of “depth” – some of them relate to the design process/approach, some to deployment platforms to be targeted, some are technical principles that drive implementation of the solution in a certain way, i.e., using certain patterns.

These principles are derived from the [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice](GDS Tehcnology Code of Practice) and [https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard](Digital Service Standards)

Following the Architecture Principles will help maintain an IT landscape across NICS that:
- meets the current needs of departments and prepares the IT landscape for evolving to meet future needs
- enables integrated services built with a citizen centred approach
- is easier to share across NICS and the broader public sector
- is easier to maintain
- scales for future use
- provides better value for money

## 5. No undifferentiated heavy lifting
  Our effort should be put where we really add value. That’s why we have a cloud first policy and focus on source software and open standards.

## 6. Be open, use open source and open standards
  Publish your code and use open source software to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability.  Build technology that uses open standards to ensure your technology works and communicates with other technology, and can easily be upgraded and expanded.

## 7. Leverage public cloud capabilities (where appropriate)  
  To modernize approach of building and hosting government solutions, gain benefits of on-demand infrastructure provisioning and scalability, ready-made platform cloud hosting should be assessed as default choice. as a service component, public
