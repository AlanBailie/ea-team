# DSS Enterprise Architecture Team Documentation
Documentation repository for the DoF DSS Enterprise Architecture team

The EA Team uses this repository to share its vision, aims and objectives, and current work (inlcuding working in progress).

The EA Team does this in order to share information in the EA Team but also to increase transparency and encourage more collaboration between the EA Team, other departments within the Northern Ireland Civil Service and our suppliers and potential suppliers.
